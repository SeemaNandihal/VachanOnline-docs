The layout of the **home page** is easy to navigate, its design makes it convenient for users to engage with and to quickly access the contents.

Without creating an account, you can access the Bible, a Parallel Bible, commentaries, dictionaries, infographics, audio bibles, movies, and reading plans.

**After signing in**, you have access to **Notes**, **Highlights**, and **Bookmarks**. With the help of this, you'll be able to add coloured highlights to your Bible study, take notes, mark your favourite chapters, share them with others, and keep track of your thoughts.
