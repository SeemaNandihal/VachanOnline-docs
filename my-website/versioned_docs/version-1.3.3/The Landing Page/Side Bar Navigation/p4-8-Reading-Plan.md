The **“Reading plan”** icon will direct you to the the classic M'Cheyne plan where you can read portions from the **Old Testament**, **New Testament**, and **Psalms** or the **Gospels** every day.

Reading the entire **Bible in a year** is possible with this reading plan.

A list of daily scripture readings appears when you click the "Reading plan" icon. Choose the section to read from the list. The necessary Bible passage appears on the left side of the screen.
